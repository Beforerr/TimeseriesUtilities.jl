A collection of utilities to simplify common time series analysis.
    
From data cleaning to arithmetic operations (e.g. linear algebra) to common time series operations (e.g. resampling, detrending).

While most are thin wrappers around existing Julia functions, they ensure proper handling of metadata and dimensions.
